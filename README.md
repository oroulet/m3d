Almost API compatible math3d replacement which is not GPL. m3d is licenced as MIT
It is currently behind the original math3d but good enough for our use. There are a few differences in API, for example properties that require computation have been replaced by methods.

Based on math3d API from Morten Lind and using code from https://matthew-brett.github.io/transforms3d/
