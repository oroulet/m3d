Almost API compatible pymath3d replacement which is not GPL. m3d is licenced as MIT
It is currently behind the original math3d but good enough for our use. There are a few differences in API, for example properties that require computation have been replaced by methods and magics like *args and **vargs are avoided as much as possible for better api discoverability.

m3d uses some code from https://matthew-brett.github.io/transforms3d/ and its API is inspired by pymath3d API from Morten Lind https://gitlab.com/morlin/pymath3d.
